    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! I’m Kush Puri, a creative enthusiast with a passion for design, video editing, and animation. I have experience in poster designing, creating visually engaging posters for various events. My approach is to combine bold visuals with clear messaging to make each design both attention-grabbing and effective.

        In video editing, I’ve worked with YouTubers, helping transform raw footage into polished, engaging content. From clipping scenes and adding smooth transitions to perfecting audio sync, I focus on crafting videos that tell a story and keep viewers interested.
        
        I also bring ideas to life through background animations, adding movement and depth to projects without overwhelming the main content. Whether it’s through subtle motion graphics or more dynamic animated elements, my goal is to make every visual feel lively and connected.
        
        Overall, I aim to create impactful visuals that resonate with audiences and capture the essence of each project.</p>
