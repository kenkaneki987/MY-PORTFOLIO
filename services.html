    <h2>Posters Designing</h2>
    <p>I’ve had the chance to work on some fun poster designs for different events, including Rishihood University’s Damru event. I enjoy crafting designs that really catch people’s eye while making the event details clear. From brainstorming concepts to adding those final touches, I make sure each poster matches the event’s vibe. It’s all about blending eye-catching visuals with the right info to create something that stands out and connects with the audience.</p>

    <h2>Video Editing</h2>
    <p>I’ve also worked on video editing projects for a few YouTubers, helping bring their content to life. From cutting clips and adding transitions to syncing audio and enhancing visuals, I make sure each video flows smoothly and keeps viewers engaged. I enjoy the challenge of turning raw footage into something polished and fun to watch, capturing the creator’s style and vibe with every edit.</p>
    <h2>Background Animation</h2>
    <p>I’ve also worked on creating background animations that add depth and movement to projects. Whether it’s subtle motion graphics or dynamic animated scenes, I aim to bring visual interest without taking away from the main content. My focus is on making animations that enhance the overall look, creating a smooth, captivating experience that keeps viewers engaged and adds that extra spark to the visuals.</p>
